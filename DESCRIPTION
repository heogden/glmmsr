Title: Fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model

Description: Conduct inference about generalized linear mixed models, with a
    choice about which method to use to approximate the likelihood. In addition
    to the Laplace and adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximations, which are
    borrowed from 'lme4', the likelihood may be approximated by the sequential
    reduction approximation (Ogden (2015) <doi:10.1214/15-EJS991>), 
    or an importance sampling approximation. These
    methods provide an accurate approximation to the likelihood in some
    situations where it is not possible to use adaptive Gaussian quadrature.
