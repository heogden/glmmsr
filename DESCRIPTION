Description: Conduct inference about generalized linear mixed models, with a
    choice about which method to use to approximate the likelihood. In addition
    to the Laplace and adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximations, which are
    borrowed from lme4, the likelihood may be approximated by the sequential
    reduction approximation, which gives an accurate approximation to the
    likelihood in some situations where it is not possible to use adaptive
    Gaussian quadrature.
